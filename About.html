      <h1>ABOUT</h1>

      <p>I've been drawing as far back as I can remember, with art always being an integral part of who I am. My passion led me to Wexford Collegiate School for the Arts in Toronto, where I developed my skills and immersed myself in the world of visual arts. After high school, I channeled my creativity into tattooing—a craft where I truly thrived. For over a decade, I built a dedicated following, creating unique, lasting art for my clients and pushing my artistic boundaries every day.</p>

        <p>As fulfilling as tattooing was, I felt the pull to expand my creative horizons even further. That's when I decided to return to school and pursue a formal education in Graphic Design. I’m excited to bring the same dedication, skill, and love for visual storytelling to this next chapter. This journey has allowed me to merge the precision and individuality of tattooing with the vast, versatile world of design.</p>
